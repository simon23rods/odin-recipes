    <h1><strong>Ingredients</strong></h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>half a cup of milk</li>
        <li>half a cup of water</li>
        <li>one fourth teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <p>Whisk flour and eggs together in a large mixing bowl; gradually add in milk and water, stirring to combine. Add salt and melted butter; beat until smooth.</p>
    <p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</p>
    <p>Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve
        hot</p>
